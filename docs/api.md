title: HTTP API
permalink: /api/
---

The below are the documented endpoints of the shared HTTP API. All requests and responses are made in JSON, and should follow RESTful standards, including respecting HTTP verbs.

For simplicity, whenever possible, the API mirrors Jekyll internal data structures, meaning, objects are generally the results of calling `.to_liquid.to_json` on an existing Jekyll model (and the resulting fields).

The API is exposed as `http://localhost:4000/_api` (or whatever server/port your Jekyll installation is running on).

**Note: Prior to version 1.0.0, the HTTP API is to be considered a pre-release API, and is subject to breaking changes without notice. You're welcome (and are encouraged) to build external tools or apps against this API, but as the API is refined and finalized, it may not strictly follow [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) standards.**

### API Request and response payloads

#### Pages and Documents

Pages and documents are JSON objects resulting from calling `to_liquid.to_json` on the underlying Jekyll object.

The resulting JSON object has the following structure:

* Top level keys are keys with special meaning. This includes:
  * Computed, read-only keys like `url`
  * Computed, read/write keys like `path`
  * Front matter defaults
* The top-level namespace will have `content` and `raw_content` keys with the HTML and markdown respectively
* The top-level namespace will have a `front_matter` key which includes the raw front matter as seen on disk.

A standard page may then look like this:

```json
{
   "some_front_matter":"default",
   "foo":"bar",
   "content":"<h1 id=\"test-page\">Test Page</h1>\n",
   "dir":"/",
   "name":"page.md",
   "path":"page.md",
   "url":"/page.html",
   "raw_content":"# Test Page\n",
   "front_matter":{
      "foo":"bar"
   }
}
```

When making a request, clients can set the following top-level fields:

* `raw_content` - the raw, unrendered content to be written to disk (currently `body`)
* `front_matter` - the entire YAML front matter object to be written to disk (currently `meta`)
* `path` - the new file path relative to the site source, if the file is to be renamed

#### Pages & Documents in subdirectories

In order to determine which pages and documents are in which subdirectories, API looks for
the project's file structure and lists all files and directories at a given path together.
Directories are represented as JSON objects resulting from calling
`JekyllAdmin::Directory.new`. The resulting JSON objects then merged with
pages/documents at the same level to be served in index endpoints.

A standard JSON object of a directory looks like this:

```json
{
  "name": "test",
  "modified_time": "2017-02-02 23:48:11 +0200",
  "path": "_posts/test",
  "type": "directory",
  "http_url": null,
  "api_url": "http://localhost:4000/_api/collections/posts/entries/test"
},
```

#### Data files and the config file

Data files are a direct JSON representations of the underlying YAML File.
A JSON object from the config file has the data segregated into two representations:

* `content` - the parsed configuration data as read by Jekyll.
* `raw_content` - the raw data as it sits on the disk.

#### Data files in subdirectories

Like Pages and Documents, Data files in subdirectories too can be requested for. The resulting JSON object is very similar to the that derived from Pages and Documents.

A JSON object from a Data file subdirectory looks like this:

```json
{
  "name": "books",
  "modified_time": "2017-04-22 10:16:40 +0200",
  "path": "books",
  "type": "directory",
  "http_url": null,
  "api_url": "http://localhost:4000/_api/data/books/"
}
```

A `GET` call to the `api_url` will return another JSON object for the constituents of the directory:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "genres",
    "modified_time": "2017-04-22 10:07:10 +0200",
    "path": "books/genres",
    "type": "directory",
    "http_url": null,
    "api_url": "http://localhost:4000/_api/data/books/genres/"
  },
  {
    "path": "/_data/books/authors.yml",
    "relative_path": "books/authors.yml",
    "slug": "authors",
    "ext": ".yml",
    "title": "Authors",
    "http_url": null,
    "api_url": "http://localhost:4000/_api/data/books/authors.yml"
  }
]
```

#### Static files

Static files are non-Jekyll files and may be binary or text.

### Collections

#### Parameters

* `collection_name` - the name of the collection, e.g., posts (`String`)

* `raw_content` - the document body (`String`)
* `front_matter` - the document's YAML front matter (`Object`)

#### `GET /collections/`

Returns an array of the registered collections.

#### `GET /collections/:collection_name`

#### `GET /collections/:collection_name/entries/:path`

Returns an array of documents and directories for the requested path.
The response does not include documents' body.

#### `GET /collections/:collection_name/:path`
