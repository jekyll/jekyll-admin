description: A Jekyll plugin that provides users with a traditional CMS-style graphical interface to author content and administer Jekyll sites. The project is divided into two parts. A Ruby-based HTTP API that handles Jekyll and filesystem operations, and a Javascript-based front end, built on that API.
---

## Installation

Refer to [Install Plugins](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/#installing-a-plugin) in Jekyll docs and install the `jekyll-admin` plugin as you would normally by adding `jekyll-admin` to the `:jekyll_plugins` group in your `Gemfile` (or) to the `gems` list in your `_config.yml`.

## Usage

2. Navigate to `http://localhost:4000/admin` to access the administrative interface
