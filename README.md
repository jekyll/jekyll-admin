[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jekyll/jekyll-admin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jekyll/jekyll-admin)

**NOTE**: jekyll-admin is not ready to be used in Jekyll yet. It will be anounced when this gem can be used with any Jekyll-powered blog properly on Jekyll's official blog.

A Jekyll plugin that provides users with a traditional CMS-style graphical interface to author content and administer Jekyll sites. The project is divided into two parts. A Ruby-based HTTP API that handles Jekyll and filesystem operations, and a Javascript-based front end, built on that API.

## Installation

Refer to [Install Plugins](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/#installing-a-plugin) in Jekyll docs and install the `jekyll-admin` plugin.

## Usage

Upon successful installation, you should be able to access the admin panel at `/admin` and the api at `/_api` respectively.
