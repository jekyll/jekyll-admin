A Jekyll plugin that provides users with a traditional CMS-style graphical interface to author content and administer Jekyll sites. The project is divided into two parts. A Ruby-based HTTP API that handles Jekyll and filesystem operations, and a JavaScript-based front end, built on that API.

## Installation

Refer to the [installing plugins](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/installation/) section of Jekyll's documentation and install the `jekyll-admin` plugin as you would any other plugin. Here's the short version:

1.  Add the following to your site's Gemfile:

    ```ruby
    gem 'jekyll-admin', group: :jekyll_plugins
    ```

2.  Run `bundle install`

## Usage

1.  Start Jekyll as you would normally (`bundle exec jekyll serve`)
2.  Navigate to `http://localhost:4000/admin` to access the administrative interface

## Options

Jekyll Admin related options can be specified in `_config.yml`
under a key called `jekyll_admin`. Currently it has only one option `hidden_links`
which is for hiding unwanted links on the sidebar. The following keys under `hidden_links` can be used in order to hide default links;

```yaml
jekyll_admin:
  hidden_links:
    - posts
    - pages
    - staticfiles
    - datafiles
    - configuration
```
